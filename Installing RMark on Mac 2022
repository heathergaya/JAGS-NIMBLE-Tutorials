I had some trouble installing MARK and RMark on my new M1-chip Mac and thought I'd write out the steps that work for me. 

Some (but not all) of them are the same as mentioned here:
https://oliviergimenez.github.io/popdyn-workshop/tutorials/rmark-mac.html

Step 1:  install RMark in R and load the library. 

Step 2: Install Xcode if you don’t already have it 

Step 3: Go to https://hpc.sourceforge.net/ and download the gcc and gfortran links that match your computer’s operating system. I am on Monterey so I will be using 12.1-m1 for all of mine. If you DON’T use Monterey, just make sure any time you see 12.1-m1 in my instructions that you switch it out for whatever you downloaded instead. 

KEY STEP: Don’t open the zipfiles manually once downloaded. 

Step 4: Open Terminal (and keep open until all is working)

Step 5: Run the following code:

    cd ~/Downloads
    gunzip gfortran-12.1-m1-bin.tar.gz
    gunzip gcc-12.1-m1-bin.tar.gz

Step 6: Run the next two lines and don’t worry about the message that says “tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors”

    sudo tar -xvf gfortran-12.1-m1-bin.tar -C / 
    sudo tar -xvf gcc-12.1-m1-bin.tar -C /

Step 7: Download MARK from here: http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/rmark/linux/ 

Step 8: Unzip the download
Step 9: Rename mark.64.osx to mark

Step 10: Copy the renamed mark file to the hidden folder /usr/local/bin on your computer. This folder can be accessed by opening your Terminal and copy and pasting:

    open -a Finder /usr/local/bin
    
    
In a perfect world, you could then type mark into your terminal and you’d be done. Continue on if you have issues. 

Part 2: Troubleshooting Attempt 1 (This helped, but not in the way I expected it to) 

If you just got the error:

Library not loaded: '/usr/local/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib'
  Referenced from: '/usr/local/bin/mark'
  Reason: tried: '/usr/local/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/X11/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib' (no such file), '/libquadmath.0.dylib' (no such file), '/libquadmath.0.dylib' (no such file)

This is because the actual location of this file is: /usr/local/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib 
But MARK expects it to be in: /usr/local/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib

So we need to link it. 

Step 1: In Terminal, run: 
    open -a Finder /usr/local

Step 2: Create a new folder in this directory called “gfortran” and then another folder inside it called “lib”

Step 3: In Terminal, run: 
  
  ln /usr/local/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib /usr/local/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib
  cd /usr/local/bin
  mark

If that works, yay! 

Part 3: A different error that might (now) emerge is: 
mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture

dyld[76654]: Library not loaded: '/usr/local/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib'
  Referenced from: '/usr/local/bin/mark'
  Reason: tried: '/usr/local/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib' (mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have (arm64), need (x86_64))), '/usr/X11/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib' (no such file), '/libquadmath.0.dylib' (no such file), '/libquadmath.0.dylib' (no such file)
Abort trap: 6

Step 1: in Terminal, we need reinstall gcc and gfortran via -x86_64 homebrew. To get homebrew (specifically -x86_64 home-brew):

    arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Step 2: In Terminal, run:

    brew reinstall gcc
    brew reinstall gfortran


(If you get the error: “The following directories are not writable by your user”
then run:
    sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig /usr/local/share /usr/local/share/info /usr/local/share/man /usr/local/share/man/man1 /usr/local/share/man/man7

    chmod u+w /usr/local/bin /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig /usr/local/share /usr/local/share/info /usr/local/share/man /usr/local/share/man/man1 /usr/local/share/man/man7

and try again
)

This process can take awhile. 

Step 3: Run:

    mdfind -name libquadmath.0.dylib 

to find where libquadmath is stored. For me, it was in 
    /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/lib/gcc/current/libquadmath.0.dylib

Step 4: Re-link this to where MARK expects it to be:

    ln /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/lib/gcc/current/libquadmath.0.dylib /usr/local/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib

Step 5: Uninstall mark (ridiculous, I know):

    rm '/usr/local/bin/mark'
    
Step 6: Reinstall MARK (same process as before)

check it’s in the right spot via the following terminal command:

    which mark 

(should spit out: /usr/local/bin/mark)

Step 7: Try Running:
mark

You might get the “Permission denied” error, but just run:

  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mark 

and (that) error will go away. Finally, we need to relink some folders.

Step 8: Run:
  open -a Finder /usr/local/opt/gcc/lib/gcc

Step 9: In finder, create a folder called “10” inside the gcc folder.

Step 10: In Terminal, run:
    ln /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/lib/gcc/current/libquadmath.0.dylib /usr/local/opt/gcc/lib/gcc/10/libquadmath.0.dylib
    arch -x86_64 zsh
    brew install nvm   
    mkdir ~/.nvm
    echo "export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm\nsource \$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh" >> .zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc


Step 11: Run:
    nvm install 16
    nvm use 16
    rm -rf node_modules

Step 12: Check work. 
When we run mark in terminal, we’ll finally get the answer:

    No input file was specified, so MARK job is done.


AND WE’RE FINALLY DONE
